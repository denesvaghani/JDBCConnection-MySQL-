# JDBC Connection-MySQL-
This code will help to connect java code to MySQL database.

Here i have used MySQL database so i write url "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/" according to it. 
I passed "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver" as argument in Class.forName() also according to MySQL.

-->for Oracle 

"oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver" this as argument of Class.forName().
and url "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe" in this formate.
